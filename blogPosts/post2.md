The best diet you can follow is the one that suits you. Every person is different, and that's why nutrition should never be one-size-fits-all—it must be personalized.

One of the most common mistakes people make is setting their health goals based on what they see in others, especially celebrities. They want to have the same body as a certain actor, or look like the lead in their favorite show. They watch influencers' "What I eat in a day" videos and want to copy everything they do. But this is where many go wrong.

We can't make someone else's body our goal—because we only see the final result, not the full picture. To look exactly like someone else, we'd have to live their exact life: follow their routine, train like them, eat like them, work as they do, sleep and hydrate the same way. And even then, we wouldn't look exactly like them—because we don't share the same genetics.

Instead of saying, "I want to look like this person," we should reframe our goals: "I want to feel stronger," "I want to be able to run a marathon," or "I want to feel energized and healthy." It's perfectly fine to be inspired by others, but the focus should always be on ourselves. That's the only way to achieve real, sustainable progress.

This is why I don't support people who recommend "miracle" diets, trending meal plans, or overly hyped programs like keto, alkaline, or detox diets. Generic approaches don't work for everyone. What helps one person might not benefit another—and in some cases, it might even do harm. Like the NIH (National Institute of Health) mentions, a bad food plan can lead to malnutrition, weakened immune system, disruption in the hormonal balance therefore irregular periods and even infertility.

The more restrictive a diet is, the more limited its nutritional value—and the harder it is to maintain. If you can only follow a diet for a short period of time, why assume it's good for your health? If something is truly beneficial and makes you feel great, it should be something you can maintain for life.

It's also time to let go of outdated beliefs that have been passed down for generations—ideas like:

* "Carbohydrates are bad."
* "Eating a lot makes you gain weight."
* "It's better to eat very little."
* "Fruit is unhealthy because it contains sugar."

What truly matters is having a diet that provides enough energy, is rich in nutrients, is balanced, diverse, safe, and suitable for your personal needs.

The WHO says that a healthy diet helps protect against all forms of malnutrition and reduces the risk of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. And that for optimal health, caloric intake should be balanced with energy expenditure.

In the end, the ideal meal plan is the one that is customized to you. It should align with your physiological needs, personal tastes, daily schedule, and long-term goals. Nutrition isn't about restriction—it's about finding what works for your body and your life.
