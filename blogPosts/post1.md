What does a healthy lifestyle mean to you? What steps are you taking to improve your health? Is it something you prioritize every day, or is it a goal you've postponed for the future—perhaps once you're older?

All too often, we take our health for granted. If we feel fine, we assume we're healthy. Illness is seen as something that only affects older adults. But what many don't realize is that the habits we build in our younger years lay the foundation for how we'll feel and function in adulthood—not just old age.

Today, we're witnessing chronic degenerative diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular conditions in increasingly younger populations. As de CDC mentions, in 2019, 53.8% of US adults aged 18─34 years had at least one chronic condition, and 22.3% had more than one condition. While these diseases are multifactorial—meaning they arise from a combination of factors—poor nutrition and a sedentary lifestyle are two of the most significant contributors.

Many people think of poor health as something extreme, like being bedridden or hospitalized. But poor health can manifest in subtle ways. Something as simple as bowel regularity, for example, is an important marker. Some individuals go to the bathroom only once every three days and consider it normal—when, in fact, a healthy frequency ranges from one to three times per day, depending on the individual.

Physical activity is another area that's often underestimated. Because many people can still perform basic daily tasks, they assume regular exercise isn't necessary. However, muscle mass naturally starts to decline around age 30 with a 3-5% decline per decade. Without intervention, this can lead to conditions like sarcopenia—an age-related loss of muscle strength that affects mobility and overall quality of life. It's often accepted as "normal" for older adults to be sedentary, but ideally, they should still be able to walk, carry groceries, and climb stairs with ease.

This is what fascinates me most about nutrition and lifestyle: how something so basic can have such a powerful impact on our health. What's even more compelling is that we get to choose whether that impact is positive or negative.

It's surprising how frequently people blame genetics for their health outcomes, when in reality, genetics account for only about 30%. The remaining 70% is influenced by lifestyle—what we call epigenetics, or how our daily habits affect gene expression.

Even with all the information available today, many still see health as a luxury, and adopting a healthy lifestyle as a punishment. Nutrition plans are viewed as temporary solutions, not as sustainable habits. Similarly, exercise is often misunderstood. Many believe it requires two hours a day at the gym lifting weights, when in fact, the World Health Organization recommends just 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both. Best of all, movement can take many forms—it can and should be tailored to each person's preferences and abilities.

That's exactly where nutrition professionals come in. We help people find their path to a healthier lifestyle—one that's sustainable, realistic, and enjoyable. We teach individuals how to eat in a way that supports their health without giving up the things they love. And we personalize every step, adapting nutrition and lifestyle plans to their tastes, routines, and goals.
